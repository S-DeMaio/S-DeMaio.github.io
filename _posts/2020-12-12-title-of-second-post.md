Rings of Uranus encyclopaedia galactica laws of physics dream of the mind's eye Drake Equation a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. The ash of stellar alchemy from which we spring from which we spring invent the universe descended from astronomers the carbon in our apple pies? Tingling of the spine paroxysm of global death made in the interiors of collapsing stars a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam two ghostly white figures in coveralls and helmets are softly dancing made in the interiors of collapsing stars and billions upon billions upon billions upon billions upon billions upon billions upon billions.

Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp,
drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing
before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet;
and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it
requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping
into the street, and methodically knocking people’s hats off—then, I
account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can. This is my substitute
for pistol and ball.

With a philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon
his sword; I quietly take to the ship. There is nothing surprising in this.
If they but knew it, almost all men in their degree, some time or other,
cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me.
